2. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in REACT requires us to plan out our components ahead of time. To break themm down into into small manageble pies in order to be able to pass props and state from parents to children and between siblings.

3. Describe state.

State is what allows you to create dynamic, interactive components. it is used to identify changes in the application based on user interaction and other factors to modify and update dynamically generated content

4. Describe props.

Props stand for properties which are arbitrary inputs to a component. They can be used to pass data between components.

Side effects are results (intended or unintended) from a function OUTSIDE scope of a function. Use `useEffect` for more control of side effects.
